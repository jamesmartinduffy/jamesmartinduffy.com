      <h1>Hi, I'm James Martin Duffy.</h1>
      <p>I’m a full-stack web developer and entrepreneur living in Seoul, South Korea. <strong>I build clean web sites and autonomous web robots for the Korean startup <a href="http://casualsteps.com/">Casual Steps</a>.</strong>

      <h2>What I’m Working On:</h2>

      <p><a href="http://www.gosnapshop.com">GoSnapShop.com</a> is an ecommerce platform that allows Korean customers to buy fashion products directly from US merchants, avoiding the markups charged by importers and local distributors. 

      <p>The platform is 100% automated. We use a combination of data feeds, product APIs, and screen scraping to update thousands of products from multiple merchants every day. When the user completes a purchase, it launches a “purchase robot” that navigates to the merchant’s website and purchases the product, arranges the cheapest international shipping through a third party shipping company (around $10 for a pair of jeans), and arranges payment of any customs fees if applicable.

      <p>To the user, this makes shopping from overseas stores as simple as a one-click purchase from an ecommerce store in their native language. To Casual Steps, being fully automated means we can scale up to handle unlimited merchants, products, and orders with minimal effort.

      <p><strong>Technologies (Nerd Stuff):</strong> The site is built on Ruby on Rails and the open-source ecommerce platform <a href="http://spreecommerce.com/">Spree Commerce</a>. For scraping / automation, we use <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and headless browsing with <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantom.js</a>. <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> and <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> are the glue that hold the app together. We use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="http://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> for development environment and server management.

      <p>Are you a rails or node.js developer living in Seoul and looking for work? <a href="mailto:james@gosnapshop.com">Get in touch</a>. We're always looking for good developers.

      <h2>Other Projects:</h2>

      <p><strong>Auragin:</strong> I started a company exporting a high-quality Korean Red Ginseng supplement to the US. I’ve been taking Korean red ginseng since the beginning of 2013, and as an entrepreneur who often works 12+ hour days, I swear by its benefits to focus and productivity. You can <!-- read more about why I take Korean red ginseng, and -->find the product on the <a href="http://auraginmall.com">Auragin website</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Korean-Red-Ginseng-Ginsenosides/dp/B00JVA8RO6/">Amazon</a>.

      <p><strong>KoreaJobFinder.com</strong>: I maintain one of the largest sites for English-speaking jobs in Korea, <a href="http://koreajobfinder.com">KoreaJobFinder.com</a>.

      <h2>Other Interests:</h2>

      <p>My number one passion is learning. I’m lucky to have a job where I have the opportunity to constantly be learning new programming technologies and improving my skillset. Outside of work, I’m currently reading a lot about automation, which I think will have colossal effects on our economy over the next 20-30 years. In general I’m addicted to knowledge and always looking to increase my understanding of the world.

      <p>I play soccer every morning to stay fit and keep my brain sharp. Aside from getting enough sleep, I think daily exercise (especially in the morning) is the most important habit a person can adopt to increase their productivity and overall life satisfaction.
