      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Fitness enthusiast. Insatiable learner. Practicing Stoic. Futurist.

      <p>I read a lot, work out or play soccer almost every day, and philosophize on the best way to live a good life in the 21st century. I believe technology's exponential growth will cause humanity to see greater changes over the next 50 years than we have in the previous 5000.

      <h2>About Auragin</h2>

      <p>I’ve been taking Korean red ginseng for the past two years, and swear by its benefits to focus and productivity and for preventing illness. The scientific studies that have been done so far point to an overwhelming number of positive effects from including ginseng supplementation in your diet.

      <p>In 2013, after being disappointed with the generally low quality of ginseng available in the US, I launched Auragin with friend and co-founder Chris Chung. We've now become one of the top-selling ginseng products on amazon.com.

      <p>Auragin is: <ul>
        <li>100% ginseng in every tablet – no additives or other fillers
        <li>Made from 6 year roots – younger roots that other brands use have a significantly lower ginsenoside content and aren't as effective (ginsenosides are the active ingredients in ginseng)
        <li>8% ginsenosides – as much as 26 times other leading brands on the market
        <li>Grown in Korea in an area with 500 years of ginseng tradition
        <li>Preserved naturally using traditional methods
      </ul>

      <p>In the year and a half since we've been in business, we've built a loyal fan base who raves about our product and have experienced strong month-over-month growth.
